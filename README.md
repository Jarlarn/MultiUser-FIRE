# MultiUser-FIRE
Built ontop of this https://github.com/ShikhSh/MultiUser-FIRE
Added a new baseline to find optimal backup location. Also plots some graphs, such as ratio of latency cost vs storage cost against backup location.

To plot the figures, change the save destination for the figures and choose the latency and storage matrices to use. Then simply run the Baseline5 file.
